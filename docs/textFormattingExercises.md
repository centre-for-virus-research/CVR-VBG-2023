## Exercises for Unix text formatting commands.

#### Copy the data to your local directory

`cp -R /home3/bvv2t/bashExp ~/.`

1. Remove multiple new lines from the file `exercise.txt`
2. Create a complementary genome sequence of `refGenome.fa`
3. Print the genome composition (number of different nucleotides) and length of `refGenome.fa`
4. Extract ORFs from `refGenome.fa` taking coding coordinates from the file `refGenomeFeatureTable.txt` 
5. Convert the FASTQ file `file.fq` to the FASTA file and save it as `file.fa`
6. Extract all the reads `file.fq` with `GAATTC` and convert and save the output in a fasta file. 

##### Please save your commands into individual files (call then example-1.txt, example-2.txt, etc...) and try running them from the terminal. What do you observe?
