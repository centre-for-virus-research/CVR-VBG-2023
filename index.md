**Welcome to CVR 6th Annual training course on Viral Bioinformatics and Genomics course (21 - 25 August 2023)**

**Location: Boyd Orr building, University of Glasgow, United Kingdom**


## Course content

The 2023 course will introduce the participants to the UNIX OS and Bash scripting along with a suite of bioinformatics tools covering the following topics: \ 

▪ HTS sequencing technologies: overview of the different HTS platforms and sample preparations \
▪ Unix OS: introduction to Unix OS and essential Bash scripting \
▪ Reference assembly: aligning sequence reads to a known reference and visualization (e.g., bowtie2, BWA, Tanoti, Tablet, UGENE) \
▪ Variant calling: consensus sequence generation, low frequency variant calling and error correction (e.g., samtools, LoFreq, DiversiTools) \
▪ De-novo assembly: overlap layout and de Bruijn graphs approaches for sequence assembly, quality assessment and merging contigs (e.g., ABySS, SPAdes, MIRA, IDBA-UD, QUAST) \
▪ Metagenomic analyses:sanitizing sequence datasets, assembling, annotating, visualization (e.g., MetAMOS, Krona, DIAMOND, Kraken) \
▪ Genomics: scaffolding, improving and finishing the assembly, gene annotation (e.g., ICORN, Artemis, RATT) \
▪ Phylogenetic analysis: introduction to multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic reconstruction (e.g., Muscle, PhyML, FigTree) \


### Prerequisites
Preference will be given to applicants who: (1) have some familiarity with HTS technologies; (2) have already or are planning to generate viral HTS data in their work; and (3) have an interest in computers and programming (some basic experience in a command-line environment is a prerequisite)

### Instructors
